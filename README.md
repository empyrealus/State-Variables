# State Variables

Stateful Variables are arbitrary variables created at runtime for the purpose of running isolated arbitrary sessions that live and die within a user browsing session. This increases security of applications in a multitiude of ways, such as removing the need to hardcode a credential value per some variable name and relatively eliminates a need for secuirty through obfusication.

I introduce Stateful Variables in their most fundemental state using Typescript to illustrate the concept.
